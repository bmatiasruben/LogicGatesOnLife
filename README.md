# LogicGatesOnLife
Based on Nicholas Carlini's "Digital Logic Gates on Conway's Game of Life", just on C++. This implementation is awfully less efficient than using the HashLife algorithm, it's just for education purposes.

For this implementation to work, you need to have installed the OpenGL library for C++.
